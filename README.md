# Orange Hackathon Project

## Overview

This project is part of the Orange Hackathon organized by Becode. The goal of the hackathon is to develop innovative solutions to real-world problems using Orange APIs.


## Project summary
The project is called Guardian. Guardian is an app for events, cities and every organistions with big zone coverage and the need to send updates to the numbers in the zone and receive alerts.

The project allows the user to enter his number and subscribe to the updates from the organisation and to send an alert.
Example : 
> John Doe is going to a big event. He wants to receive updates when he's the event and be able to send an alert if there's a problem. 
> John subscribes to the updates and receive the updates by SMS.
> If there's any problem John can send an alert with his location to the staff and they can intervene fast.

This project is using 2 APIs from Orange.

  2. Device Location Retrieval
